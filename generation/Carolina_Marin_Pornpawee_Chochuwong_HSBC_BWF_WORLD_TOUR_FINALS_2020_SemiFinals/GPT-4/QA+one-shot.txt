Moving into the second set, Marin maintained her relentless pressure, this time exploiting repeated errors from Chochuwong, who hit the net 6 times contributing significantly to her demise. Marin's smashes continued to be devastating, adding a pair of crucial points to her tally. Her consistent performance at the net was once again a downfall for Chochuwong, costing her 6 points in errors.

The match concluded with a fitting demonstration of Marin's superiority, as Chochuwong failed to clear the net, handing the last point and the victory to Marin with a net shot. With this, the game wrapped up at an identical 21-13, underscoring Marin's utter control throughout the semifinals.

With this victory, Carolina Marin not only demonstrates her readiness for the finals but also her skill in executing a game plan to perfection, leaving her opponent trailing in both strategy and score.
