- Fluency: 9

The badminton report is largely fluent, characterized by good usage of grammar, punctuation, and appropriate word choices. The narrative is clear and well structured, showcasing consistency in tense and a strong command of subject-verb agreement. Sentence structures are varied and contribute to an engaging narrative flow. The report engages the reader effectively without causing confusion or ambiguity. One point is deducted as there is room for slight improvement in ensuring absolute precision and clarity without any negligible errors present in a top-tier report (e.g., subtle style consistencies), but overall, it demonstrates a high level of proficiency in writing.
