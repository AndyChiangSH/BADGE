From the onset, Marin showcased her dominance on the court with a series of aggressive and accurate shots, pushing Yigit to the limits. The first set saw Marin opening a substantial lead early on, as she capitalized on Yigit's errors.

Marin executed several high-quality smashes and wrist shots, and her tactical awareness was evident as she often left Yigit scrambling with well-placed lobs and drops. Marin's ability to consistently win points by forcing errors from Yigit—either hits to the net or shots out of bounds—was critical to her victory.

After her victory, Marin expressed satisfaction with her performance, noting her focus on maintaining a high intensity throughout the game and exploiting her opponent's weaknesses. Yigit, while disappointed, acknowledged Marin's superiority on the day and hoped to learn from the experience.

With this win, Carolina Marin advances confidently to the semifinals, continuing her quest for another title in this prestigious tournament. Her performance today firmly establishes her as one of the top contenders for the crown.
