Moving into the second set, the pattern seemed familiar, with Axelsen maintaining pressure and once again, both players mirrored their frequent errors from out-of-bounds shots, losing nine points each. However, Viktor’s strategic gameplay shone through as he adapted to a more varied style, earning his most points on out-of-bounds errors forced on Ng. Viktor again came from behind, this time with a skillful lob to move ahead at 4:3. Demonstrating his tactical prowess, Axelsen finalized his victory as Ng failed to clear the net with a net shot, a disappointing end for the Hong Kong player but a victorious moment for the Dane.
