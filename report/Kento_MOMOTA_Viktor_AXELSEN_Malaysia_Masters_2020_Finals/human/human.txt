MOMOTA, CHEN UNCHALLENGED – MALAYSIA MASTERS: FINALS

[Kento Momota](https://bwfworldtour.bwfbadminton.com/player/89785/kento-momota/) and [Chen Yu Fei](https://bwfworldtour.bwfbadminton.com/player/78778/chen-yu-fei/) continued from where they left off last year, claiming singles honours at the [PERODUA Malaysia Masters 2020](https://bwfworldtour.bwfbadminton.com/tournament/3687/perodua-malaysia-masters-2020/) today.

Momota completed his 14th win in 15 matches against [Viktor Axelsen](https://bwfworldtour.bwfbadminton.com/player/25831/viktor-axelsen/), and in the process completed his third title win on the trot after the Fuzhou China Open and the HSBC BWF World Tour Finals.

Today’s final against Axelsen was unusual, for it all hinged on a point late in the first game. The opening game was a high-quality contest, with both showing patience in working out openings. The Dane recovered well from a 13-18 deficit and led into the final stretch; on his second game point he sprang to the net and whipped the shuttle past Momota – but his celebration was cut short by the umpire who ruled a fault.

Momota saved one more game point before going ahead. The loss of the game seemed to deflate Axelsen and the Dane slipped, falling behind 3-17 in quick time.

It was then Momota’s turn to waver, and he eased his foot off the pedal to allow Axelsen a mini-comeback. The gap was too wide, however, and Axelsen let the last shuttle fall unchallenged.

“I’m pleased to have won the first tournament this year,” said Momota. “We know each other’s game and I had to be careful. He was playing really well and had a lead. I thought I had even lost it before the umpire ruled a fault.”

“It’s all part of the game,” philosophised Axelsen. “I did my best and unfortunately today it wasn’t my day. I played a very good first game and I’m happy with that. I played good badminton over the week. I haven’t digested the match yet, but I did my best. Tomorrow’s a new day.”
