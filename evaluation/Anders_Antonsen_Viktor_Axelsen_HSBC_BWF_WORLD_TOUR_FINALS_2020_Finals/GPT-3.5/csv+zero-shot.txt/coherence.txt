- Coherence: 8

Overall, the badminton report on the HSBC BWF WORLD TOUR FINALS 2020 provides a well-structured and coherent narrative of the match between Anders Antonsen and Viktor Axelsen. The report begins with a clear introduction, then moves through details of each set in a logical sequence, ending with the final outcome which nicely concludes the narrative. Each sentence contributes to building a narrative around the match, helping to maintain coherence throughout the report. However, there could have been a slightly more varied sentence structure or additional analysis to enrich the narrative, but this is a minor issue in the context of overall coherence.
