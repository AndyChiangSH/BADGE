Coherence: 7

The report on the BWF Yonex Thailand Open 2021 finals presents a reasonably coherent narrative, primarily focusing on the matchup between Viktor Axelsen and Angus Ng Ka Long. The information flows well from the introduction of the players and their head-to-head record to specific details about their playing styles and past performances.

The structure of the report includes a clear introduction and develops into more detailed analysis as it progresses, which helps in building a coherent narrative. Sentences are generally clear and relevant, contributing to the overall understanding of both players' standing before the final match.

However, the report mixes aspects of the game analysis with individual player attributes in a manner that slightly disrupts the narrative flow. For instance, after discussing Long's performance and strategies, the report switches to Axelsen's physical attributes and playing style, which could have been integrated more smoothly.

Points are deducted due to some sentences that seem slightly disjointed, particularly when transitioning from discussing one player to another. Further enhancement in the logical connection between these sections could improve the coherence of the report.
