To evaluate the consistency of the badminton report, I need to verify the factual accuracy of the match details provided in the report based on a reliable source or official record of the YONEX Thailand Open 2021 Finals between Viktor Axelsen and Ng Ka Long Angus. However, since the source material or event details were not provided explicitly in your prompt, I cannot verify the exact facts such as the scoreline or specific events during the match.

Given this situation and assuming the absence of contradictory information, the report appears to communicate a consistent narrative that could be plausible for a badminton match at this level, describing match dynamics, player tactics, and final outcomes that align with common occurrences in professional badminton.

As such, if the provided scores, player names, and events (like the comeback and consistent strong performance by Axelsen) align with an accurate record (not provided here for direct verification), the report would score high on consistency.

Without proof of any factual inaccuracies or 'hallucinated facts', and in the absence of the source material for direct comparison, I would tentatively rate the report:

- Consistency: 9

The deduction reflects the slight uncertainty due to the lack of direct access to source verification rather than observed inconsistencies. If contradictory details were available from a reliable source specifying different outcomes or details, this score would need to be adjusted accordingly.
