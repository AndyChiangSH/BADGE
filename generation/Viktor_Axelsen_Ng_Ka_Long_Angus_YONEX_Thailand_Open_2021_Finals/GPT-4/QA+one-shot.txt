YONEX THAILAND OPEN 2021: AXELSEN TRIUMPHS OVER NG KA LONG ANGUS

The finals of the YONEX Thailand Open 2021 saw a dominant performance from Denmark's Viktor Axelsen as he outplayed Hong Kong's Ng Ka Long Angus in straight games, asserting his supremacy on the badminton court.

In a match that lasted under an hour, Axelsen showcased a tactical masterclass against Angus. The first set saw the Danish star secure a comfortable 21-14 victory. A notable aspect of Axelsen's gameplay was his ability to force errors from Angus, with six critical points gained as Angus' shots went out of bounds. Axelsen's aggressive play was complemented by his smashing abilities, racking up another six points with powerful smashes that Angus struggled to return.

The frustration was palpable for Angus, who most frequently lost points due to his lobs being skillfully countered by Axelsen. The Hong Kong player tried to recalibrate and find openings, but the Danish player's defensive and offensive transitions were seamless, leaving little room for Angus to maneuver.

The second set mirrored the first, with Axelsen taking another 21-14 win. Once again, Angus' attempts frequently flew out of bounds, handing nine points over to Axelsen. The Daneâ€™s strategy remained consistent, playing a high line against Angus and tactically placing lob shots, which saw him overtaking Angus early in the set with a pivotal score change at 4:3.

Axelsen's versatility was on full display as he ended the game with a net shot that Angus failed to clear, crowning a well-deserved victory with strategic finesse. Despite Angus' best efforts, including losing five points to Axelsen's deceptive drops, it was the Dane's day as he controlled the flow and pace of the match, indicating a strong continuation of form.

With this win, Viktor Axelsen not only secured the title but also emphasized his standing as one of the top players in the world with a clear and present demonstration of skill and strategic depth on the court.
