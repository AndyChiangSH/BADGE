At the YONEX Thailand Open 2021 climactic match, Danish badminton star Viktor Axelsen demonstrated a masterclass in precision and power, defeating Hong Kong’s Ng Ka Long Angus in straight sets, 21-14, 21-14, to capture the title.

In the first set, Axelsen employed a varied attack but was particularly devastating with his smash, amassing 6 points with this stroke alone. Angus, struggling with control, frequently sent shuttles out of bounds, which turned out to be his undoing, relinquishing 6 points on errors of this nature. Notably, Axelsen seized the lead early, using a clear shot at 2:1, and closed the game emphatically with a point-winning smash.

The second set mirrored the first in score but not in pattern. While Axelsen's smashes were less dominant, contributing to only 1 point this time around, it was the errors from Angus that continued to plague him. Misjudgments and mishits led to 9 points lost to out-of-bound errors. Despite a more modest lead this time, Axelsen overtook at 4:3 using a well-placed lob, and the game culminated with Angus failing to clear the net by a net shot, signaling Axelsen’s decisive victory.

Viktor Axelsen’s triumph was marked by his strategic play and adaptability, taking full advantage of his opponent’s weaknesses while showcasing a strong repertoire of shots that kept Angus on the defensive throughout the contest. This win not only emphasized Axelsen's dominance but also highlighted the areas for Angus to refine to contend at this high level of international competition.
