Coherence: 8

Explanation: The badminton report is well-structured and maintains a good flow from one segment to another, with clear transitions that build a coherent narrative around the achievements and statements of the players involved in the semi-finals. The sentences are mostly clear and contribute to the overall story of the competition. However, the report jumps directly into details about specific matches without a brief introduction to the tournament context or the importance of the matches, which might slightly affect the coherence for readers not already familiar with the tournament's significance. Each segment contributes well to a central narrative, although some more direct links or comparisons between the performances of the players across matches could further enhance the coherence.
