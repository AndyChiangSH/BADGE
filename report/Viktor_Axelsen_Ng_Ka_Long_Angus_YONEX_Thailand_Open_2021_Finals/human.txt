BWF Yonex Thailand Open 2021 Finals: Viktor Axelsen vs Angus Ng Ka Long

Fourth seed, Viktor Axelsen sets up an exciting title clash against the seventh seed, Angus Ng Ka Long in the Thailand Open on 17th Jan, 2021

The head to head record between both the players is completely one-sided with Axelsen leading it 9-0 against Angus. The Dane has also won his last 3 matches against the World number 8 in straight games.

Despite trailing by a significant margin of points in his matches, Long has taken a streak of points continuously to turn the tables. His struggles to finish matches have also been displayed.

Viktor Axelsen has recovered fully after undergoing ankle surgery last year. Standing at a towering height of 6 foot and 4 inches, the Dane has a powerful smash and is very strong from the backcourt with his attacking game.

He can struggle a bit when he is forced to retrieve regularly or when he plays around the net a lot. But the World number 4, Axelsen can run away with the game if he takes the early charge on by playing aggressively from the frontcourt. His speed and agility are close to none when he is in full flow.
