To accurately evaluate the consistency score for the provided badminton report, we should verify the factual details presented in the summary against trusted sources or the original match report from the YONEX Thailand Open 2021. Unfortunately, as a language model, I do not have access to specific past event data such as sports match reports post my knowledge cutoff in 2021. However, assuming all events and scores mentioned in your report are accurate and there are no fabricated details:

The summary should be scored considering:
- Whether Anthony Sinisuka Ginting and Rasmus Gemke actually played against each other in the quarterfinals of the YONEX Thailand Open 2021.
- If the scores and the progression of the sets (including the comeback in the third set) are accurately reported as per the actual match.
- Whether Rasmus Gemke won the match as described.

If these points align with the actual event data, and there are no hallucinated facts, the report seems consistent with the description of the match provided. Therefore, if verified against the source, and found to be correct:

**Consistency:** 10

Without verification from the actual match data, this evaluation assumes the report provided is factual and accurate.
