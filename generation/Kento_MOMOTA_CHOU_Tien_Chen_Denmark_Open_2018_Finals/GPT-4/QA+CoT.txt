In an exhilarating showdown at the Denmark Open 2018 Finals, Kento Momota clashed with Chou Tien Chen in a fiercely contested match, which saw Kento clinching victory in a dramatic three-set battle.

The match commenced with a closely fought first set. Momota overcame Chou with a score of 22-20, displaying strategic prowess with 7 wins by landing, which appeared to be his most effective tactic in this set. Evenly matched throughout, Momota tactically used a 'return net' stroke to overtaking the lead for the first time at a crucial point, scoring 16-15. He eventually sealed the set with a precise net shot.

However, Chou Tien Chen retaliated strongly in the second set, taking it 21-16 over Momota. Throughout this set, Chou’s most frequent scoring came from causing his opponent to push shots out of bounds, tallying up 7 points from this error alone. He effectively maintained his lead and eventually concluded the set with a significant point when Momota lobbed the shuttle out of bounds.

The deciding third set was an embodiment of tension and high stakes. Momota regained his composure and dominance, taking the set 21-15. His ability to force errors proved crucial, with 8 points directly coming from Chou's shots landing out of bounds. He once again showed his strategy versatility by overtaking the lead early in the set with a scoreline at 5:4 using a lob, and he brought the match to a victorious close with a forced error from Chou, making a compelling out-of-bounds push shot.

Kento Momota’s ability to adapt and capitalize on his opponent's errors while mixing up his play styles, especially with net returns, smashes, and lobs, was pivotal in his victory. Meanwhile, Chou’s performance, although strong, was marred by critical unforced errors. This match not only highlighted Momota’s resilience but also his tactical acuity on the court.
