The first set demonstrated a tightly contested battle between the players, with each point being fiercely contested. The game began with Chou taking the early lead, showing superior control as he sent several shots out of Momota's reach and cleverly played into Momota’s weaknesses. Chou initially built a good lead, but Momota made a significant comeback by capitalizing on Chou’s errors, such as shots hitting the net and some going out of bounds.

Despite the back-and-forth nature of the game, the first set saw an increase in intensity as both players neared the 20-point mark, racing to clinch the set. It was Momota who showcased resilience by sealing the first set 22-20 with a well-placed net shot, after a series of powerful smashes and rapid rallies.

The set followed a similar trajectory of intensity toward the end, but this time it was Momota who maintained the lead, eventually closing the set 21-15 with a strategic push out of bounds forced on Chou.

Going into the third set with high stakes, Chou needed to alter his strategy to reclaim his ground against an evidently upbeat Momota. That set, however, belonged almost wholly to Chou, who came back invigorated and more strategically adept. By maintaining pressure through a varied play that included net shots, wrist smashes, and forcing errors from Momota, Chou dominated the scoreboard. Momota attempted to claw back with several winners but couldn't withstand Chou's aggressive play. Chou sealed the third set with a decisive 21-16 score, demonstrating his ability not just to survive but to effectively counter-attack under pressure.

Overall, the match was a rollercoaster of momentum shifts where control of the game oscillated between Momota and Chou.
