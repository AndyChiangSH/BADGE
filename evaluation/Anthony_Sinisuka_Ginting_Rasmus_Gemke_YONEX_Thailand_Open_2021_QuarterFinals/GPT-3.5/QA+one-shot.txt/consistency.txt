To evaluate the consistency of the badminton report provided, we need to verify its factual alignment with the actual events of the match between Anthony Sinisuka Ginting and Rasmus Gemke at the YONEX Thailand Open 2021 Quarterfinals.

Based on the content of the report, there are some concerns about the factual accuracy regarding the progression and outcome of the match:

1. **Match Format in Badminton**: Typically, badminton matches are played as best of three sets. The winner is declared when a player wins two out of the three sets. The report mentions results for all three sets, which suggests that all three sets were played. However, the winner of two sets should conclude the match, which is inconsistent if considering how badminton scoring usually works.

2. **Match Outcome**: The report states that Anthony Sinisuka Ginting won the first two sets, which should have concluded the match in his favor based on standard badminton rules. However, the report then states Rasmus Gemke won the third set, which contradicts the typical progression of a badminton match, as mentioned previously.

3. **Checking Authentic Sources**: Without access to the original source or an ability to authenticate the details provided against a reliable source, evaluating for hallucinated facts becomes difficult. However, based on standard knowledge of badminton match play, the details provided raise doubt.

Given these inconsistencies based on general knowledge of badminton and how matches are conducted, the consistency score for this report will be lower. Since key elements such as the number of sets needed to win the match and the overall winner are misreported or unclear based on typical badminton rules, the factual alignment is compromised.

Thus, the consistency score should be adjusted to reflect these factual errors and contradictions concerning standard match procedures:

- **Consistency**: 3/10

The score reflects critical inconsistencies and potential inaccurate reporting of the match outcome, which impacts the factual reliability of the report.
