TOYOTA THAILAND OPEN 2021: CAROLINA MARIN DOMINATES QUARTERFINALS

In a display of sheer dominance, Carolina Marin sailed into the semifinals of the Toyota Thailand Open 2021 after sweeping past Turkey’s Neslihan Yigit in straight sets during the quarterfinals. 

From the onset, Marin showed her prowess and intent on the court, overpowering Yigit with a commanding 21-6 win in the first set. The Spanish shuttler was relentless, accumulating a notable 11 points from Yigit's errors of hitting out of bounds. Yigit, struggling to find her rhythm, lost the majority of her points by returning into the net, which tallied up to four by set’s end. Marin, while cautious in her gameplay, only clinched a single point through a clear, but secured her dramatic lead early on using a well-timed lob at 2-1.

Progressing to the second set, Yigit put up a firmer resistance, scoring 15 points compared to her initial 6. Nevertheless, Marin maintained control, sealing the set at 21-15. Once again, unforced errors plagued Yigit’s performance, with a significant 8 points conceded by hitting the net. Marin exploited these errors, also netting the most points with her aggressive smashes, scoring four points directly. The turning point of the set was Marin's tactical play that saw her using return net to reclaim the lead at 12-11, ultimately closing out the set and match when Yigit failed to negotiate a passive drop over the net.

Carolina Marin’s strength and strategy on the court were too much for Neslihan Yigit, whose efforts, though improved in the second set, fell short of mounting a real challenge. Marin’s advancement to the semifinals sets expectations high as she continues to demonstrate why she remains one of the top contenders in the sport.
