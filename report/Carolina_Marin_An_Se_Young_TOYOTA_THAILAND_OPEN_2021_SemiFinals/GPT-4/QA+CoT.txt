She maintained her lead throughout and concluded the game with another accurate rush shot that landed in Young’s court, sealing her victory.

The match was a testament to Marin’s experience and her ability to exploit the game's critical moments to her advantage. Young, while exhibiting great skill and promise, was outmaneuvered by Marin's strategic gameplay and powerful shot selection. Marin's approach to strategically using landing shots and transitioning to aggressive net and rush shots when needed reflects her adaptability and tactical acumen.

With this win, Marin progresses to the finals, where she stands to further demonstrate her dominance in the sport. An Se Young, although not victorious, displayed commendable talent and resilience, marking her as a promising player in future tournaments.
