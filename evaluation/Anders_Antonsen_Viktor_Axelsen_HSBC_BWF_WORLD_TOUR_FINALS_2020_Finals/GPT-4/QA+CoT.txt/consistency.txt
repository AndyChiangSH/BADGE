To provide a score for the "Consistency" category based on the Evaluation Criteria provided, I must ensure that the facts presented in the badminton report are aligned accurately with the original source material. Unfortunately, without access to the original source document for the HSBC BWF World Tour Finals 2020 involving a match between Anders Antonsen and Viktor Axelsen, this task can't be verified for factual alignment, specific match details, or the description of play and scoring as described.

Given that I cannot check the accuracy against an original source, I must base the Consistency score on the internal consistency, clarity, and credibility of the details provided within the report itself. The report appears internally consistent, presenting a detailed and coherent account of the match, descriptions of each set, and the performance dynamics between the two players.

If we accept the report's internal details at face value and acknowledge that it is well-constructed and logical in its account of the badminton match, the score for consistency would theoretically be high. However, the real accuracy can only be confirmed by comparing it to the original source material.

Since I'm unable to perform this verification and must rely solely on the coherence and detailed nature of the report provided, I will assign a tentative score based on these observations:

- Consistency: 8

This score regards the report as articulate and internally coherent but reflects the inability to verify factual alignment with the original source material directly.
