To properly evaluate the consistency of the badminton report based on the guidelines provided, it is important to ascertain that the facts presented in the report align with verified outcomes and events from the HSBC BWF WORLD TOUR FINALS 2020. The lack of access to the original source material in this simulation makes it challenging to assess factual alignment with certainty. 

The report details specific scoring events and player strategies, such as Anders Antonsen's use of powerful smashes and Viktor Axelsen's ability to capitalize on opponents' mistakes. It claims that Axelsen won the match, which is the type of detail that can be easily verified.

If I assume all the information provided in the report is correct according to historical match data (as no source document has been provided for direct comparison here), the report seems to present detailed game strategies and outcomes that are typical in badminton matches, making it appear factually coherent.

Given these assumptions:  
1. The report displays a scenario in which factual data concerning game scores and key moments (like specific shots and point gains) would importantly impact the reader's understanding of the match, stressing the need for factual accuracy.
2. The clarity in describing each set, who won each, and how the players performed in terms of their playing strategies contributes positively, assuming these actions are factual.
3. Without citing unverified or hallucinated facts, considering the coherence within the elaborated match details, which portray a typical match progression in badminton.

As an evaluator, given no blatant incongruences are observed from the standard expectations of a badminton report and assuming the accuracy of match details, my rating for the consistency of the report would be:

- Consistency: 9

This score reflects good confidence in the factual consistency of the report based on the information provided, albeit with the minor caution that a detailed comparison with the precise source is not possible here.
