DENMARK OPEN 2018 – The best are the best

Kento Momota was the top seed but he took over the world #1 spot from Viktor Axelsen in late September.  He came in with a 3-match winning streak over Chinese Taipei’s Chou Tien Chen but the world #4 won their first meeting in 2018 en route to winning the German Open.

Chou Tien Chen has been one of the busiest top ten players in the past few months, if not the past year.  He has played 7 tournaments (plus the Asian Games team event) in the last 12 weeks and in the last 8 weeks, he has reached 5 semi-finals, converting 3 of those into appearances in the finals.

Chou’s stamina issues were not helped by the end of the first game.  After the two players battled to 20-all, Kento Momota (pictured right) hit an impossibly good net tumble then was not faulted even though the reply clearly showed he’d reached over the net to kill a reply from Chou that was not going to even make it over the net.  Momota beat Chou on the same front forehand corner one rally later and claimed the first game 22-20.

Chou bounced back to win the second game – despite being unable to convert on his first 4 game point opportunities – but then Momota surged ahead late in the decider to cap off his victory.  Momota thus claimed his 5th title of the year.  As two of these were the World and the Asian Championships, he has been accumulating slightly fewer points on the BWF World Tour and is now the only world #1 who did not also finish the weekend on top of the Race to Guangzhou standings.

All of the finalists will now head to Paris for the French Open Super 750.  Chou Tien Chen and Zheng/Huang have put themselves in the position such that they are assured of qualifying for the World Tour Finals as long as they merely step on court for their first round matches in Paris, Fuzhou, and Hong Kong.
