- Excitement: 7

The report effectively conveys the excitement of Carolina Marin's dominant performance with vivid descriptions of her gameplay and tactics. The specific scores and detailing of her strategies against Yigit help in building a scene of the match that is engaging and interesting, particularly for fans of the sport. However, the report might lack a bit in capturing the broader thrill of the competition and the emotional highs of the game that could bring a reader closer to the edge of their seat. It focuses more on the technical aspects and the outcome rather than the intense emotive experience usually associated with live sports. Therefore, while it is engaging and well-written, there is room to enhance the expression of exhilaration and passion that could elevate the excitement score further.
