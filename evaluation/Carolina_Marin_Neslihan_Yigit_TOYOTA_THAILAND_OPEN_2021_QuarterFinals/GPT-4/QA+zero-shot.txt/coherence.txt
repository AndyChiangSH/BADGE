- Coherence: 9

Explanation: The report is quite well-structured and coherent overall. It opens with a clear introductory statement about the event and the achievement of Carolina Marin. It then moves logically through an analysis of the different sets of the match, detailing specific instances that demonstrate Marin's strengths and Yigit's weaknesses, and concludes with remarks about Marin's prospects. Each sentence contributes appropriately to building a cohesive narrative, offering both specific examples and overall commentary on the match's significance in the tournament. The transitions between different points are smooth, assisting in maintaining the coherence of the report. There might be room for a slightly deeper analysis of Yigit's strategies or moments beyond her struggles to enhance the balance, but overall, the report is coherent and effectively communicates its main points.
