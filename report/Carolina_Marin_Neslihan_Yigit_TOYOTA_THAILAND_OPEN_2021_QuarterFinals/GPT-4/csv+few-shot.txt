TOYOTA THAILAND OPEN 2021 QUARTERFINALS: CAROLINA MARIN EASES PAST NESLIHAN YIGIT

In a dominant display at the Toyota Thailand Open 2021, Carolina Marin sailed into the semifinals with a convincing victory over Neslihan Yigit, defeating the Turkish competitor with scores of 21-6 and 21-15.

Right from the start of the match, the Spanish champion Marin showcased her superiority by taking an early lead and maintaining firm control throughout the first set. Yigit struggled against Marin's aggressive play from the baseline and precise net shots which led her to commit multiple errors. Marin capitalized frequently, pushing Yigit out of bounds, and finished the set with a powerful return net shot, winning it comfortably at 21-6.

The second set saw a slightly more determined Yigit trying to mount a comeback, nudging closer at several points, even leveling the score at 7-7 and again at 13-13. However, Marin's consistency and her ability to force errors with her precise and powerful smashes became the key. As Yigit faltered under pressure, Marin stepped up her game, delivering crucial points with winning smashes and rush shots which culminated in sealing the set and the match with a passive drop shot Yigit failed to clear.

Marin's performance was a masterclass in control and aggression, hardly faltering throughout the encounter. Her strategy to deploy wrist smashes and force errors by playing deep lobs and cross-court net shots wore down the resilience of Yigit, who, despite a spirited fight in the second set, could not match Marin's pace and precision.

Marin's victory propels her to the next round, setting expectations high as she nears another potential tournament win. Neslihan Yigit, on the other hand, will take this as a learning experience, analyzing her play to focus on reducing unforced errors and improving her court coverage against top-tier opponents.
