His strategic use of the court seemed to overwhelm Ng, who struggled to mount a sufficient defense against Axelsen's diverse attack. Ng attempted to even the score with several well-timed rushes and cross-court net shots but fell short as Axelsen's responses proved too robust, culminating in a 21-14 set win for the Dane.

The second set mirrored the first, with Ng gaining an early lead of 0-3 through precise drives and relentless rushing tactics. Despite this, it wasn't long before Axelsen regained composure and returned to form, efficiently tying the game at 3-3 and eventually dominating with an 8-4 lead fueled by an unyielding barrage of smashes and drops that often found Ng out of position. Ng struggled with landing judgment errors and cleared the shuttle out of bounds several times under pressure, aiding Axelsen's march toward victory.

Ng made a valiant attempt to recover midway through the second set, securing a few points through aggressive smashes and smart placement that briefly disrupted Axelsen's rhythm. Nonetheless, Axelsen maintained his resolve, and with consistent net play and forceful clears, he wrapped up the set and match at 21-14, thereby defending his title at the Thailand Open with a commanding performance.
