The Danish powerhouse, Viktor Axelsen, showed why he remains a formidable force in world badminton by taking the match 21-14, 21-14.

The game opened with Ng showing promise as he scored the first point, but Viktor quickly adapted, displaying his mastery over the shuttle with consecutive wins, particularly using his cross-court net shots and powerful smashes. Errors seemed to plague Ng, especially with shots hitting the net and going out of bounds which allowed Axelsen to gain a significant advantage.

Throughout the first set, despite brief attempts by Ng to claw back into the game with effective rushes and pushes that eked out a few points, Viktor's aggressive play and near-perfect court coverage saw him closing the set comfortably at 21-14. Viktor's judgment on landing shots put him in good stead, blunting Ng's attempts to rally.

Transitioning to the second set, Ng once again started strongly, quickly taking a 3-point lead. However, as with the first set, this did not intimidate Viktor, who quickly regained control. Utilizing a mix of precision drops and powerful smashes, he not only caught up but once again took the lead. His unyielding defense and ability to turn defensive plays into winning smashes were key factors that constantly kept Ng on the back foot.

Ng Ka Long Angus seemed to find some rhythm mid-set, momentarily bridging the score gap with well-placed smashes and agile net plays. However, consistency was king, and Viktor demonstrated this with a series of point wins from net errors and out-of-bounds shots made by Ng. As the match drew towards a close, Viktor's relentless pressure and tactical gameplay were evident and uncountered.
