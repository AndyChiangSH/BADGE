In the first set, Marin opened a strong lead, with a clear early dominance by winning the first five points continuously, attributing most of these points to Pornpawee's unforced errors by sending the shuttle out of bounds and hitting the net. Her relentless pace and pinpoint accuracy visibly shook Chochuwong who managed to score her first point with a successful landing on a push.

Yet again, Marin pulled ahead aggressively, continuing to exploit the unforced errors from Chochuwong. The scoreboard rapidly ticked in Marin’s favor as she continued her assault without relenting, maintaining the lead throughout and finalizing the win with a net shot. Marin concluded the match with a score of 21-13 in the second set, replicating the scoreline of the first.

Marin's performance was highlighted by her strategic play and skillful net shots which created significant pressure causing Chochuwong to falter under the high stakes. Chochuwong showed flashes of brilliance with her smashes but struggled to maintain consistent play against Marin’s onslaught.

With this victory, Marin moves forward to the finals, showcasing her readiness to reclaim her prestigious standing in international badminton.
