To evaluate the consistency of the badminton report provided against the source material, I would need the actual source document to make a direct comparison. Since I don't have the source document for this specific report, I can't accurately assess the alignment of facts in the report to verify factual consistency or to identify any hallucinated facts. Therefore, I'm unable to provide a consistency score based on the given evaluation criteria. Assuming all facts in the report are accurate without verification from the source document, it would seem the report might be consistent, but without the comparison, confirming this is not possible. Thus, I cannot assign a score for Consistency.
