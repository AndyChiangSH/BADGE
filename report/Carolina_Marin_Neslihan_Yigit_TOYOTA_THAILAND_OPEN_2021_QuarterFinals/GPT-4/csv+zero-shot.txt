In a dominating display at the TOYOTA THAILAND OPEN 2021 Quarter-Finals, Carolina Marin sailed past her competitor, Neslihan Yigit, in straight sets (21-6, 21-15). From the outset, Marin's powerful gameplay and strategic finesse were on full display, asserting her dominance early in the match.

In the first set, Marin left little room for Yigit to build any momentum. By relentlessly pressing with accurate lobs and wrist smashes, Marin sped to a significant lead. Yigit's several attempts to counteract, mostly ended in errors such as failing to clear the net or hitting shots out of bounds. By exploiting these faults with precision, Marin closed the first set convincingly at 21-6. Particularly commendable were Marin’s return nets and clears that consistently found Yigit struggling.

The second set saw a somewhat more spirited response from Yigit, managing to notch points through a few well-timed shots landing and pushing Marin momentarily on the back foot. Despite this, Marin’s unyielding approach and powerful smashes retained control, bringing the scores to a close call mid-set. Both players exchanged points, with Yigit displaying significant resilience, taking the fight to Marin and even leading briefly.

However, Carolina Marin swiftly regained her poise, taking advantage of successive errors from Yigit—who grappled with hitting the net and sending shots out. Marin adeptly closed the match with a series of rushes and smashes, ensuring her victory with a final score of 21-15 in the second set.

Carolina Marin's performance was a masterclass in tactical badminton, effectively leveraging Yigit's errors while showcasing her strength and agility. As she progresses through to the semi-finals, her form suggests she is a formidable contender for the title. Neslihan Yigit, although outmatched today, showed flares of potential that could see her come back stronger in future tournaments. Today, however, belonged unequivocally to Carolina Marin.
