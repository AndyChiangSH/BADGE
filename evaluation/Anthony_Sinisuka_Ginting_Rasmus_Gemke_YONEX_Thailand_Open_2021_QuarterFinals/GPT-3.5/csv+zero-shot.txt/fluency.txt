- Fluency: 8

The report is generally well-written with good grammar, effective punctuation, and coherent sentence structures. It conveys the exciting nature of the match effectively with appropriate word choices. However, there are minor issues which affect fluency slightly: there is a technical error in stating "clinched the set 21-21" in Set 3, since a badminton set doesnâ€™t conclude on a tied score, indicating a possible lapse in understanding or typographical error. Overall, the report is engaging and largely fluent but could be enhanced with closer attention to the details and rules of badminton.
