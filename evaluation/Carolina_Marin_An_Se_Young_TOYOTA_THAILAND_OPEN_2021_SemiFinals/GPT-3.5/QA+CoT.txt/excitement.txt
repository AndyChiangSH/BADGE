- Excitement: 7

This report on the TOYOTA THAILAND OPEN 2021 semi-finals match between Carolina Marin and An Se Young successfully conveys a level of excitement and anticipation typically associated with competitive badminton. The close scoring, particularly in the first set where the scores were tight at 21-19, suggests a thrilling competition. The language describing Marinâ€™s come-from-behind moments and the specific actions in shots like the rush shot, net shot, and smash, does create an engaging narrative for those interested in the sport's technical aspects. 

However, while the report does a good job of detailing the game's progress and outcomes, it could further enhance excitement by incorporating more emotive language and vivid descriptions of the atmosphere, player emotions, and crowd responses. These elements could help elevate the excitement level to resonate more intensely with the reader, making the experience more dynamic and lively.
