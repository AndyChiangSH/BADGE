**Game Analysis**

The Spaniard won two out of three matches in the group stage. She will be looking to win her third World Tour Super 1000 title in a row capping off a successful run in the Thailand leg of the season.

Tai displayed her class against Se-Young in the semis who was running high on confidence after edging past Marin in three games in the final match of the group stage. Despite making some unforced errors here and there, the World number 1 used her reverse slices and trick shots to perfection leaving the South Korean searching for answers.

"My performance today was not too bad, I told myself before entering the match that I needed to play patiently because An Se Young is a player who does not make mistakes easily, I hope that I can prepare well for tomorrow’s final, everyone is tired because we are in the third week and I just wish to focus now and be patient,” opined Tai sounding optimistic about her chances in the summit clash.

“I could show my determination on the court that I wanted to win today and I did, and I am happy with my performance, Tai and me will play our third final in a row, so it is tough but I am looking forward to the final, I want to give my best and will try to enjoy it," said Marin quite pleased with her showing.

Marin will start as the favorite and has been unstoppable so far. Tai has the speed and variety of shots to challenge the World number 6. She will look for revenge having lost finals in a row to the Spaniard.
