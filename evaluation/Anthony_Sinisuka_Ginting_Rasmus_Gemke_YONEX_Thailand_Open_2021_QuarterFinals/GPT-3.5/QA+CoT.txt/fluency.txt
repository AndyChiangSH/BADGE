- Fluency: 8

This report is largely well-composed with minimal grammatical errors and shows a good use of language and technical terms relevant to badminton. However, some awkward phrasing and slight repetition in explanations ("wins by landing" repeated multiple times) detract slightly from the fluency. Transitional phrases laced effectively between points would enhance the overall readability and flow of the report.
