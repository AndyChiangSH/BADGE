**FLUENCY: 8** 

Explanation: The report is generally well-written with clear sentence structures and appropriate terminology related to badminton. A few grammatical and punctuation issues ("was able to take advantage of Anthony and lose by a very large margin of points" should perhaps be rephrased for clarity, and the double quotation marks could be adjusted for consistency) slightly distract from the overall coherence. However, the report maintains a good flow and readability, effectively conveying the updates and sentiments from the match. Further refinement could improve the score, but as it stands, it is quite fluent.
