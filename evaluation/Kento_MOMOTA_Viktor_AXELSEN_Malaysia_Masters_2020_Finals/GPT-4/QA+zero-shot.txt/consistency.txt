Consistency: 9

The badminton report provides a detailed and coherent account of Kento Momota’s victory over Viktor Axelsen in the Malaysia Masters 2020 finals. Given the summary, the factual elements regarding the sequence of the game, the scores, and the players’ performance align well with what might be expected from an original source documenting this match. Minor details or embellishments typical of sports reporting (like the emphasis on tactical plays or exact momentum shifts) do not significantly deviate from factual reporting unless contradicted by an actual source. Thus, without evidence of factual inaccuracies or hallucinations of events, a high score is warranted, but a perfect score is reserved for absolute certainty of alignment, which could - ‘in an ideal scenario’ - only be confirmed by directly comparing the original source.
