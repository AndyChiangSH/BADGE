Excitement: 7

Explanation:
The badminton report effectively captures the thrill of the match between Carolina Marin and An Se Young, particularly highlighting the come-from-behind victories in both sets, which enhances the excitement. The use of specific badminton terminologies like "wins by landing," "rush shot" and "net shots," adds to the anticipation and thrill, making it engaging for readers familiar with the sport. However, to reach a wider audience and increase excitement, the report could benefit from further descriptive details about the atmosphere, player emotions, and crowd reactions. Though engaging and adequately exciting, the report sticks predominantly to the technical aspects of the game, which might limit its appeal exclusively to those who are already fans of badminton. The emotional impact and broader appeal could be improved to fully maximize the excitement level, hence the score of 7.
