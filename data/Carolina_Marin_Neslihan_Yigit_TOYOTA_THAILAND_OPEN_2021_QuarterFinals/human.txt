Ratchanok reaches badminton semi-finals 

"Earlier in the day, Spanish fifth seed and former world number one Carolina Marin sailed through to the women’s semis, beating Turkey’s Neslihan Yigit 21-6, 21-15.

The 27-year-old Spaniard, ranked sixth in the world, is aiming for back-to-back titles in this week’s tournament — the second of three consecutive events in Bangkok that culminate in next week’s World Tour Finals.

She came out on top last week against top-seeded Tai, and continued her winning streak on Friday — despite Yigit holding a brief lead in the second set.

“I wanted to keep going, keep fighting and keep the focus on what I needed to do, even when Yigit was leading,” said Marin.

Marin will face off on Saturday against South Korean An Se-young, a formidable teenager who was awarded “Most Promising Player” in 2019.

They already duelled in last week’s tournament, with the more experienced Marin winning in a quick 21-18, 21-16 match.

The 18-year-old, ranked ninth in the world, said she would need to up her mental game in preparation for their showing on Saturday.

“If I want to win against Marin, I need to focus more than last time and have more confidence,” An said, after she disposed of Thailand’s Pornpawee Chochuwong in a 21-15, 21-18 match full of smashes and attacks."
