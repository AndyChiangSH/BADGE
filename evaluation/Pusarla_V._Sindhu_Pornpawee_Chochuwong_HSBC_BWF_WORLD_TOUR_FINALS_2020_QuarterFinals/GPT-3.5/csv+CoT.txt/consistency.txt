To properly evaluate the consistency score for the Badminton Report, it is essential to verify whether the events and results mentioned in the report align accurately with those from the actual HSBC BWF World Tour Finals 2020. Unfortunately, without access to specific external data confirming or denying the exact details (e.g., match results, player performance specifics mentioned such as scores 21-18 and 21-15, or progression to semifinals) from the said tournament, evaluating factual alignment purely based on the text provided is challenging.

However, making a reasonable assessment based on the structure and details in the report:
- The report provides specific scores and mentions the progression of the match in a realistic manner typical to badminton tournaments.
- There are no obvious logical discrepancies or fabricated elements from the details given (assuming typical reporting and known players).

If the information about players' actions, the sequence of sets, and the outcomes per the report are assumed to reflect possible real events accurately:

Given that I do not have the specific source material to reference, I would conservatively rate the consistency based on the observed detail level, logical presentation, and typical event portrayal:

- Consistency: 8

This score reflects a tentative evaluation, assuming no explicit inconsistencies or factual errors are evident without cross-referencing the actual event data.
