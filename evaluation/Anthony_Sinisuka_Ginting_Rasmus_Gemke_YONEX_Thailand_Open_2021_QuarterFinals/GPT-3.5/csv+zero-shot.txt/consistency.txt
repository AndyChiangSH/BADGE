Based on the badminton report provided, there are several key aspects to consider in terms of factual alignment and accuracy:

1. **Review for Factual Alignment**: The structure of the detailed match, including the description of gameplay in the sets and the victorious outcome for Ginting, must be directly referenced against a reliable source. If the described actions, scores, and outcomes of each set do not align accurately with an official record or verifiable source, the consistency is compromised.

2. **Assess Clarity and Accuracy**: The report is clear and well-structured, providing a detailed breakdown of the sets. However, inconsistencies or inaccuracies in set scores or match outcomes can significantly impact the factual reliability. One visible inconsistency is in Set 3, where the reported score was "21-21." This score is not possible as per badminton scoring rules, indicating an error or fabricated detail. 

3. **Final Consistency Rating**: The match was portrayed in line with typical badminton summaries, however, the inaccuracy in the scoring for Set 3 (21-21) which contradicts the official scoring system used in badminton (a set is won by the first player/team to reach 21 points, and there must be at least a 2-point lead unless the score reaches 29-29, in which case the next point determines the winner). This error reflects a significant factual inconsistency, and there might be no official record supporting this specific scoring, hence it appears as a hallucinated fact.

Given the factual error found in the concluding set's score, the summary's overall consistency is impacted. While other elements of the report might align with what could have happened, the blatant scoring error cannot be overlooked.

**Evaluation Form (scores ONLY):**

- Consistency: 4

The score reflects a substantial inconsistency due to the incorrect and impossible score in Set 3, which undermines the factual reliability of the report.
