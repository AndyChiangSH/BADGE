MALAYSIA MASTERS 2020 FINALS: MOMOTA BESTS AXELSEN IN STRAIGHT SETS

In a riveting finale at the Malaysia Masters 2020, Japan's Kento Momota claimed a straight-set victory over Denmark’s Viktor Axelsen. The match was a display of tactical brilliance from Momota, who adapted to in-game pressures masterfully to take the win.

Set one was a nail-biting affair that saw Momota narrowly clinching the game with a 23-22 scoreline. The Japanese shuttler demonstrated his exceptional control, most notably forcing his opponent to hit 6 shuttles out of bounds. This factor generated crucial points for Momota, allowing him to build pressure on the Dane. Moreover, his effective use of smash shots scored him 2 crucial points, showcasing his offensive prowess. The game witnessed a turning moment where Momota used a tactful push to overtake Axelsen at a score of 9:8, before eventually sealing the game with a decisive smash.

The second set was markedly less competitive, with Momota dominating 21-11. Again, his strategy to exploit Axelsen’s errors paid off, with the Dane sending the shuttle out of bounds 7 times due to Momota’s pressure. In this set, Momota varied his attack, using 3 rush shots effectively to garner points, showing his adaptability and control over the pace of the game. He did not allow any room for a comeback, maintaining a robust lead throughout and finally ending the match with a skillful return net shot.

Viktor Axelsen struggled with his net play, losing points primarily through net shots in the first set and push shots in the second. This seemed to undermine his typical robust gameplay, preventing him from establishing any rhythm.

Kento Momota’s ability to consistently pressure Axelsen into errors and flawlessly switch between offensive and defensive play was the highlight of the day, earning him the title at the Malaysia Masters 2020 with a performance that combined precision, power, and strategy to perfection.
